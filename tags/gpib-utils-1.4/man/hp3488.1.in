hp3488 \- control HP 3488A switch/control unit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B hp3488 [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhp3488\fR controls the HP 3488A switch/control unit via its GPIB interface.
.PP
\fBhp3488\fR performs actions selected on the command line in a fixed sequence:
.IP
.nf
clear
perform self test
list installed options
list valid channels
open channels
close channels
query channel states
start shell
local
.PP
If an action is not selected on the command line, it is not performed.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBhp3488\fR accepts the following command line options:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-address\fR address
Override the default instrument address in /etc/gpib-utils.conf.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR
Clear the instrument, verify its model number, and open all channels.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR
Enable front panel.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-selftest\fR 
Perform unit self test.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR \fBm,m,m,m,m\fR
Specify the card models installed in slots 1,2,3,4,5.  ``0'' indicates
that the slot is empty.  
See CARD OPTIONS for a list of valid model numbers.
If this option is not used, 
.B hp3488
will probe the instrument for installed cards.  For models 44471, 44476,
and 44477, this will result in momentary closure of channels 04 and 09 
as this is the only way to tell those cards apart.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-showconfig\fR
List the cards installed in each slot including model number, description, 
and the card's range of two-digit channel numbers.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
List valid channel addresses.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-query\fR \fBchannels\fR
Query the state of the specified channels.
See CHANNEL ADDRESSES below.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-queryall\fR
Query the state of all channels.
.TP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-open\fR \fBchannels\fR
Open the specified channels.
See CHANNEL ADDRESSES below.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR, \fB\-\-close\fR \fBchannels\fR
Close the specified channels.
See CHANNEL ADDRESSES below.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-shell\fR
Start an interactive shell. Type ? for help.
.SH "CHANNEL ADDRESSES"
Channel addresses are three digits: a single slot digit (1-5) and two
channel digits.
.PP
Multiple channel addresses may be separated by commas (no spaces), e.g.
``101,102,103,104'', or as a hyphenated range enclosed in square 
brackets, e.g. ``[101-104]'', or a combination, e.g. ``[101-109],[201-209]''

44470 10 Channel Relay Multiplexer
The 44470A Relay Multiplexer assembly consists of ten 2-wire relays connected 
to a common analog bus.  Two modes of operation are possible: single channel,
break-before-make or multiple channel closed together.
Basically there are two different ways the 44470A may be used: 
inputs from 10 different sources may be switched to the one common bus or 
one input (common bus) may be switch to 10 different places.
This module uses latching relays.
.TP
44471 10 Channel General Purpose Relay
The 44471A General Purpose Relay Module consists of 10 independent single
pole - single throw switches.  More than one switch can be closed at a time.
Therefore, if necessary, high and low signals can be switched by using a
pair of channels.  Two modes of operation are possible, single-channel
break-before-make or multiple channels closed together.  At turn on or reset
(either from the front panel RESET key or the HP-IB CLEAR command), all relays
on the 44471A will be opened.  This module uses latching relays.
.TP
44472 Dual 4 Channel VHF Switch
This option provides two independent 4 channel to one coaxial multiplexers.
These multiplexers are specifically designed for broadband signal switching
up to 300Mhz.  This module is the logical choice for wide dynamic range 
measurements with spectrum and distortion analyzers.  The two groups are
isolated from each other and also from the 3488A chassis ground.  The shield
of each channel is not switched; the shields of the four channels of each group
are in common.  Characteristic impedance is 50 ohms.  This module uses
latching relays.
.TP
44473 4x4 Matrix Switch
This module provides a 4x4 matrix of switches.  Each node or crosspoint
in the matrix switches both signal Hi and Lo (2 wires).  Matrix switches
provides a convenient way to connect a group of test instruments to multiple
test points on a device or to multiple devices.  This matrix switch
offers high flexibility for testing devices over a frequency range of DC
to 100 kHz.  Any combination of the 4 inputs (e.g. rows) may be connected
to amy combination of outputs (e.g. columns).
.TP
44474 16-bit Digital I/O
This option provides 16 bidirectional data lines (channels) plus 4 lines
used for control and handshaking.  All lines are TTL compatable.  Several
modes of operation are possible including 
1) Addressing individual lines on a bit-by-bit basis, addressing as 
two 8-bit ports or addressing all 16 lines as one word;  
2) positive or negative true logic;
3) Several handshake modes;
4) External increment and channel closed signals for hardware controlled
scanning;
5) Several commands to write data to and read data from the module.
The two 8-bit ports are completely independent of each other and may be used
separately.  For instance, one port can be used for output operations, the
other for input.  They can also be used together for 16-bit operations.

44476 Microwave Switch
The 44476A module contains three HP 33311B option 011 microwave switches
designated as channels 00, 01, and 02.  These switches have the following
features:
1) Broad bandwidth (DC to 18 GHz, usable to 24 HHz);
2) High isolation (>90dB to 18 GHz);
3) Excellent repeatability (typically 0.03 dB after 1,000,000 switchings);
4) Internal 50 Ohm terminations.
.TP
44477 Form C Relay
The 4447A module consists of seven independent, break-before-make, SPDT 
Form C relays (one contact normally open, one contact normally closed).
The relay contacts (common: C; normally open: NO; and normally closed: NC),
are accessible at the terminal block for field wiring connections.
Typical uses are signal switching and power applications (250V, 2A).
Additionally, this module is suitable for driving remote RF, coaxial, and
microwave devices.
