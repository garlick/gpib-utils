gpib-utils-1.3 Release Notes                                   2007-11-23 
=========================================================================

* VXI-11 support for devices behind a Ethernet-GPIB gateway such as
  ICS 8065, or with built-in Ethernet ports such as the Agilent 6000 
  series oscilloscopes.

* Added config file: /etc/gpib-utils.conf.  Place device addresses here
  and overridde with -a option on command line.  If linux-gpib is used,
  /etc/gpib.conf need only contain bus master device information.

* Added support for new devices:
  - a6032 Agilent 6000-series oscilloscopes
  - dg535 Stanford Research Systems DG535 digital delay/pulse generator 
  - sr620 Stanford Research Systems SR620 Universal Time Interval Counter
  - ics8065 ICS Electroncs 8065 Ethernet-GPIB Controller
  - hp3488 Hewlett-Packard 3488A Switch/Control Unit

* Removed support for old instruments that I no longer have access to
  and which I know of nobody using:
  - r5005 Racal Dana model 5005 DMM
  - hp3455 Hewlett-Packard 3455A DMM
  - tek2230 Tektronix 2230 oscilloscope (never really working)
