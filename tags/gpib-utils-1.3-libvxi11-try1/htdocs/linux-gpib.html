<h2>Setting up gpib-utils with linux-gpib</h2>

gpib-utils optionally works with <a href="http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/">
linux-gpib</a>.
<p>
Presuming linux-gpib is installed in the usual place your system puts 
include files and libraries, type:
<pre>
   cd gpib-utils
   make all-gpib
</pre>
To install in /usr/local/{bin,man}, type:
<pre>
   make install
</pre>
<p>   
You will need an /etc/gpib.conf file for your GPIB controller card, and
an /etc/gpib-utils.conf file for your instruments.  Refer to the 
sample config files in gpib-utils/etc.
<p>
After you have set up your config files, loaded the linux-gpib driver 
for your interface board, and run gpib_config, you can verify that everything 
is set up properly by running ibtest and making sure an instrument responds 
to simple commands such as:
<p>
<ul>
<li>HP1630/31: "BP" should cause the analyzer to beep.
<li>HP3457: "TONE" should cause the DMM to beep.
<li>HP8656: "FR200MZ" should change the carrier frequency to 200 MHz
<li>DG535: "DS hello" should display the string "hello" on LCD
</ul>
<p>
The most recent linux-gpib configuration I have tested was on Fedora 7:
linux-gpib-3.2.09, kernel 2.6.21.1.3228.fc7, and a National Instruments
GPIB-USB-HS.
