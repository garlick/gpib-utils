<h2>Adding VXI-11 Support to gpib-utils</h2>

The <a href="http://www.vxibus.org/?q=node/206">VXI-11.3 specification</a>
defines a protocol based on ONC RPC for
communicating with instruments over ethernet, either natively to a LAN
jack on the back of an instrument, or via an Ethernet-to-GPIB gateway.
<p>
Adding VXI-11 support to gpib-utils was a matter of including the
<tt>vxi11.x</tt> ONC RPC definitions from the VXI-11 spec (pulled from
the Agilent application note examples referenced below), adding Makefile 
targets to generate the stubs for the VXI-11 services with rpcgen, and adding 
VXI-11 function calls to <tt>gpib.c</tt>, where all gpib-utils's I/O functions 
are wrapped.  Because the <tt>gpib.c</tt> wrappers were already there, it was 
possible to add VXI-11 support without modifying the instrument utilities 
themselves, although in some cases it was necessary to alter error handling
code to more gracefully exit, shutting down RPC services to avoid leaving 
the other end of the connection to time out.
<p>
Each utility takes a <tt>--address</tt> command line argument, used to 
specify the instrument address which is passed to the gpib.c wrapper 
initialization function.  If the address contains a colon, the 
initialization function now interprets it to be a VXI-11 
<i>hostname:logical_device</i>, otherwise it is 
assumed to be a numeric GPIB primary address.  For example, a native 
VXI-11 instrument might be called <tt>meter:inst0</tt>, an instrument at GPIB 
address 9 behind an Ethernet-to-GPIB controller such as the ICS 8065 might 
be addressed as <tt>gpibgw:gpib0,9</tt>, and the same instrument directly 
attached to a GPIB card would simply be addressed as <tt>9</tt>.  
For convenience, a configuration file <tt>/etc/gpib-utils.conf</tt> 
has been added so that default addresses can be entered there for each 
instrument and the <tt>--address</tt> argument does not have to be used 
every time.  In earlier releases of gpib-utils, each instrument was expected
to be present in /etc/gpib.conf.  This is no longer necessary.
<p>
Since gpib-utils is rather unsophisticated in its use of GPIB facilities,
only the core VXI-11 channel was used.  The abort and intr (SRQ) channels
were not implemented.  VXI-11 device locking is not used.  It is possible
that future releases of gpib-utils will implement a feature similar to
linux-gpib <i>autopoll</i> using the SRQ reverse channel and posix threads.
<p>
Note that gpib-utils now compiles standalone without linux-gpib by default.
To build against linux-gpib, run "make clean" then "make all-gpib" at the
top level Makefile.
