## gpib-utils

*gpib-utils* is a set of command line utilities for specific instruments
and a source framework for building new ones.

It leverages the *linux-gpib* kernel modules for GPIB host interfaces,
but also includes a VXI-11 library and can operate standalone with
network connected instruments, or traditionally wired instruments
behind a VXI-11 gateway.
