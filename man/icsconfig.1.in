.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBicsconfig\fR is used to configure and access the error log of 
ICS Electronics VXI-11 based instruments such as the
8064 Ethernet-Relay Interface,
8065 Ethernet-GPIB Controller,
and 9065 Ethernet-GPIB Controller.
ICS implemented an open RCPL-based configuration interface
across all of their VXI-11 based instruments.
Not all devices implement all functions.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBlist\fR
Display device configuration.
.TP
\fBget\fR NAME
Get and display the configuration attribute NAME.
.TP
\fBset\fR NAME=VALUE
Set the configuration attribute NAME to VALUE.
Changes do not persist across a reboot unless they are saved with
the \fBcommit\fR command.
.TP
\fBreload\fR
Reload the configuration from flash memory.
.TP
\fBfactory\fR
Reload the flash memory with factory defaults.
The active configuration is not modified until a \fBreload\fR or reboot.
.TP
\fBcommit\fR
Save the configuration to flash memory.  The configuration is loaded
from flash upon device reboot.
.TP
\fBreboot\fR
Reboot the device.  All device links will be cleared, all connections closed,
and all resources released.  Upon reboot, the configuration settings
from flash will be used.
.TP
\fBerrlog\fR
Display the device's stored error log, one per line.
The error log can contain up to 100 enties.
This command clears the error log.

.SH ATTRIBUTES
.TP
\fBident\fR
The model number, serial number, firmware revision, and other information.
This attribute is read-only.
.TP
\fBenable-dhcp\fR
If \fIno\fR, \fBip-address\fR, \fBip-netmask\fR, and \fBip-gateway\fR
should be set.  If \fIyes\fR, these values will be obtained dynamically
from a DHCP server.
.TP
\fBip-address\fR
The device IPv4 address.
This value is ignored if \fBenable-dhcp\fR is set to \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBip-gateway\fR
The device IPv4 gateway.
This value is ignored if \fBenable-dhcp\fR is set to \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBip-netmask\fR
The device IPv4 netmask.
This value is ignored if \fBenable-dhcp\fR is set to \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBhostname\fR
The device hostname.
.TP
\fBtimeout\fR
TCP timeout valaue, in seconds.  An inactive TCP channel will be left
open this length of time before being closed.
A value of zero means no timeout checking.
.TP
\fBkeepalive\fR
The keepalive value, in seconds.
This is the time of inactivity prior to a keepalive being sent.
A value of zero means keepalives will not be used.
.TP
\fBvxi11-interface\fR
The device's VXI-11 interface name.
.TP
\fBgpib-address\fR
The device's GPIB bus address.
The valid range is 0 to 30.
.TP
\fBgpib-controller\fR
GPIB controller mode, \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR.
If enabled, the device will initialize at boot time as the GPIB bus controller.
.TP
\fBgpib-ren-mode\fR
If \fIyes\fR, GPIB REN will be asserted at boot time.
