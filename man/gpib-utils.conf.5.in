.SH NAME
gpib-utils.conf \- configuration file for gpib-utils

.SH DESCRIPTION
The gpib-utils.conf file defines default instrument addresses, flags,
and other information for the gpib-utils utilities so addresses do not
have to be provided on the command line.  It is a standard INI config file,
with semicolon-prefixed comments, and a section for each instrument beginning
with the instrument name in square brackets, followed by key=value attributes.
The attributes include address, flags, manufacturer, and model.
.LP
If the environment variable GPIB_UTILS_CONF is set to a file path,
this is used as the config file.  Otherwise, first ~/.gpib-utils.conf,
then @X_SYSCONFDIR@/gpib-utils.conf are tried.
.SH ADDRESS FORMAT
Instrument addresses are specified with the \fBaddress\fR attribute.
The value can be in one of the following formats:
.TP
\fB[board:]primary[,secondary]\fR
GPIB devices addressed by board index, primary address, and secondary address.
The board index is assumed to be 0 if unspecified.
Secondary addressing is not used if the secondary address is unspecified.
Primary and secondary addresses are normally in the range of 0 through 30.
.TP
\fBhostname:instr[,primary[,secondary]]\fR
The address for a native VXI-11/LXI device is the device's
IP address or host name usually concatenated with ``:inst0''.
The address for a GPIB device behind a VXI-11/GPIB gateway is the
IP address of the gateway with a string representing the GPIB bus
and addresses, for example ``:gpib0,15'' or ``:gpib0,2,30''.
.TP
\fBdevice[:flags]\fR
Serial support is not yet implemented.
.TP
\fBhostname:port\fR
Socket support is not yet implemented.
.SH FLAGS
Instrument flags are specified with the \fBflags\fR attribute.
The value is a comma-separated list of flag names.
The flag names are as follows:
.TP
\fBreos\fR
If set, reads are terminated when the end-of-string character is read.
