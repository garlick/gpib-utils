.SH NAME
gpib-utils.conf \- configuration file for gpib-utils

.SH DESCRIPTION
The gpib-utils.conf file defines default instrument addresses for 
the gpib-utils utilities so addresses do not have to be provided on the
command line.
.SH FILE FORMAT
Empty lines and anything prefaced with a # character is ignored.
Instruments are defined one per line.
Each instrument definition is an instrument 
name and instrument address separated by white space.
.LP
Instrument names are the same as the gpib-utils utility name.
.LP
Instrument addresses can be in one of the following formats:
.TP
\fBGPIB address\fR \fI[board:]primary[,secondary]\fR
GPIB devices addressed by board index, primary address, and secondary address.
The board index is assumed to be 0 if unspecified.
Secondary addressing is not used if the secondary address is unspecified.
Primary and secondary addresses are normally in the range of 0 through 30.
.TP
\fBVXI-11 address\fR \fIhostname:instr[,primary[,secondary]]\fR
The address for a native VXI-11/LXI device is the device's
IP address or host name usually concatenated with ``:inst0''.
The address for a GPIB device behind a VXI-11/GPIB gateway is the 
IP address of the gateway with a string representing the GPIB bus 
and addresses, for example ``:gpib0,15'' or ``:gpib0,2,30''.
.TP
\fBserial address\fR \fIdevice[:flags]\fR
Serial support is not yet implemented.
.TP
\fBsocket address\fR \fIhostname:port\fR
Socket support is not yet implemented.
