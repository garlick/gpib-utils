.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhp6626\fR controls the HP 6625A/6626A/6628A/6629A multiple output
power supply via its GPIB interface.
\fBhp6626\fR performs actions in the order they appear on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBhp6626\fR accepts the following command line options:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-address\fR address
Override the default instrument address in @X_SYSCONFDIR@/gpib-utils.conf.
See gpib-utils.conf(5) for a description of address formats.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR
Clear the instrument to its power-on state, disables its output,
and clears any OVP or OCP condition.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR
Enable the front panel.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-get\-idn\fR 
Print instrument model.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-selftest\fR 
Run instrument selftest.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-out-chan\fR \fI[1-4]\fR
Select an output channel.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-iset\fR float
Set current in amps for the selected channel.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-vset\fR float
Set voltage in volts for the selected channel.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-irange\fR float
Set current range in amps for the selected channel.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-vrange\fR float
Set voltage range in volts for the selected channel.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-out\-enable\fR 0|1
Enable/disable output for the selected channel.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-ovset\fR float
Set the overvoltage threshold in volts for the selected channel.
The programmable OV is a protection feature which can be set by the 
operator to protect the load against excessive voltage.  When the actual 
voltage exceeds the programmed overvoltage setting for a given output 
channel, the OV is tripped. The OV circuit will fire the SCR crowbar 
which shorts across the output and the output assumes a low impedance state.
Use the \-\-clear option to reset the instrument after tripping the OV.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-ocp\fR 0|1
Set over-current protection off or on for the selected channel.
The OCP is a protection feature employed by the power supply to guard 
against excessive output currents. When the output enters the + CC mode 
and the OCP is enabled, the OCP circuit down programs the output voltage 
and disables the output. 
Use the \-\-clear option to reset the instrument after tripping the OCP.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-samples\fR number
Select number of current and voltage samples to take [Default 0].
Output is in the format ``time V1 A1 V2 A2 V3 A3 V4 A4'' with all fields
separated by tabs.  The time is omitted if only one sample is requested.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-period\fR period
Set sample period [Default 0s].
