.SH NAME
gpib.conf \- configuration file for gpib-utils

.SH DESCRIPTION
The gpib-utils.conf file defines default instrument addresses for 
the gpib-utils utilities so addresses do not have to be provided on the
command line.
.SH FILE FORMAT
Empty lines and anything prefaced with a # character is ignored.
Instruments are defined one per line.
Each instrument definition is an instrument 
name and instrument address separated by white space.
.LP
Instrument names are the same as the gpib-utils utility name.
.LP
Instrument addresses can be in one of two formats: 
.TP
\fBGPIB address\fR (0-30)
The integer address for a device behind a local linux-gpib board.
.TP
\fBVXI-11 address\fR
The address for a native VXI-11/LXI device is the device's
IP address or host name usually concatenated with ``:inst0''.
The address for a GPIB device behind a VXI-11/GPIB gateway is the 
IP address of the gateway with a string representing the bus and address,
for example ``:gpib0,15'' for bus zero, GPIB address 15.
