.SH NAME
icsconfig \- configure ICS Electronics VXI-11 based instruments
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B icsconfig [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBicsconfig\fR is used to configure and access the error log of 
ICS Electronics VXI-11 based instruments such as the
8064 Ethernet-Relay Interface and
8065 Ethernet-GPIB Controller.
ICS implemented an open RCPL-based configuration interface
across all of their VXI-11 based instruments.
Not all devices implement all functions.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBicsconfig\fR accepts the following command line options:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-address\fR address
Specify the hostname or IP address of the target device.
This option is required.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-get-errlog\fR
Get and display the decoded error log, which contains up to 100 entries.
As a side effect, the error log is cleared.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-get-interface-name\fR
Get the VXI-11 logical name.
.TP
\fB\-J\fR, \fB\-\-set-interface-name\fR name
Set the VXI-11 logical name, e.g. ``gpib0'' or ``inst''.
The name must be no longer than 31 characters.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-get-comm-timeout\fR
Get the TCP timeout, in seconds.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-set-comm-timeout\fR secs
Set the TCP timeout.
An inactive TCP channel will be left open this length of time before being
closed.  A value of zero means no timeout checking.
The timeout only applies to the core and configuration channel settings.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-get-static-ip-mode\fR
Get the static IP mode setting.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-set-static-ip-mode\fR 0|1
Set the static IP mode setting.
If static IP mode is disabled, DHCP is used.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-get-ip-number\fR
Get the static IP address.
.TP
\fB\-Z\fR, \fB\-\-set-ip-number\fR ip-address
Set the static IP address (ignored if using DHCP).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-get-netmask\fR
Get the static IP netmask.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-set-netmask\fR ip-address
Set the static IP netmask (ignored if using DHCP).
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-get-gateway\fR
Get the static IP gateway.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-set-gateway\fR ip-address
Set the static IP gateway (ignored if using DHCP).
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-get-keepalive\fR
Get the IP keepalive time.
.TP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-set-keepalive\fR time
Set the IP keepalive time, in seconds.  The keepalive time is the period
of inactivity after which a keepalive is set.  If set to zero, keepalives will 
not be used.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-get-idn-string\fR
Display idn string using ICS config RCPL, if implemented (8065 only).
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-get-gpib-address\fR
Get the device's GPIB address (8065 only).
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-set-gpib-address\fR [0-30]
Set the device's GPIB address (8065 only).
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-get-system-controller\fR
Get the system controller mode (8065 only).
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-get-system-controller\fR 0|1
Set the system controller mode (8065 only).
If enabled, the device will initialize at boot time as the GPIB bus controller.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-get-ren-mode\fR
Get the REN mode (8065 only).
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-set-ren-mode\fR 0|1
Set the REN mode (8065 only).
If true, REN will be asserted at boot time.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-reload-config\fR
Force a reload of the default configuration settings from nonvolatile RAM.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-commit-config\fR
Save the current configuration settings to nonvolatile RAM.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reboot\fR
Reboot.  All device links will be cleared, all connections closed,
and all resources released.  Upon reboot, the default configuration settings
from nonvolatile RAM will be used.
