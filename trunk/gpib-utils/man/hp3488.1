.SH NAME
hp3488 \- control HP 3488A switch/control unit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B hp3488 [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhp3488\fR controls the HP 3488A switch/control unit via its GPIB interface.
The instrument is presumed to be attached to GPIB adapter 0 and configured 
with an entry in /etc/gpib.conf (see CONFIGURATION below).
.PP
\fBhp3488\fR performs actions selected on the command line in a fixed sequence:
.IP
.nf
clear
perform self test
list installed options
open channels
close channels
query channel states
local
.PP
If an action is not selected on the command line, it is not performed.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBhp3488\fR accepts the following command line options:
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR
Override the name used to look up the device in /etc/gpib.conf.
Default: \fIhp3488\fR.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR
Clear the instrument, verify its model number, and open all channels.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR
Enable front panel.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-selftest\fR 
Perform unit self test.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
List the cards installed in each slot including model number, description, 
and valid channel numbers.
Note: in order to distinguish 44476 and 44477 from 44471 we must close 
channel 4 and 9 and look for errors, therefore this option may 
momentarily alter the state of those cards.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-query\fR \fBcaddr[,caddr]\fR
Query the state of the specified channels.
Channel addresses are three digits: card number (1-5) followed by two
digit channel number as reported by the \fB\-\-list\fR option.
A single digit is interpreted as a slot number, in which case all
channels for that slot are reported.
.TP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-open\fR \fBcaddr[,caddr]\fR
Open the specified channels.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR, \fB\-\-close\fR \fBcaddr[,caddr]\fR
Close the specified channels.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-queryall\fR
Query the state of all channels.  Note: this option will not alter
the state of any channels, thus it lists 10 channels for the 4-channel 44476 
and 7-channel 44477 cards (see note under \fB\-\-list\fR description).
